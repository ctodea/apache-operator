Therefore we would kindly ask you to create a basic Ansible Operator with the following functionality:

* Deploy an apache webserver (Amount of replicas defined by CustomResource)
* Create a Route/Ingress containing a Name defined in the CustomResource
- The Pods should serve a simple HTML File (Either defined in CustomResource or ConfigMaps
- Apache configuration should be rendered from a template and saved into a configMap

The following parameter should be configurable via CustomResource:
* Port apache listens on (rendered in apache.conf and service)

If a change to the configMap happens the operator should also trigger a redeployment of the webserver.


- add OLM bundle 
- fix manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml `Error: container create failed: time="2021-04-17T17:21:39Z" level=error msg="container_linux.go:366: starting container process caused: chdir to cwd (\"/home/nonroot\") set in config.json failed: permission denied"
- make handler check httpdconfig
Since http need to write stuff on the folder conf, it can be directly mounted as a volumeMount, because that cause the whole directory to be mapped to the config map, which woulld prevent http from wiriting.
Since I found no elegant solution, a initContainer that mounts an emptydir, loads the file(s) magic too... and then that volume is used for conf, and since that is not mapped to a configmap, httpd will be able to
do its stuff on it.
            
 but with different name for httpd.conf
- try watches.yml with configmap and handler


- move magic out of /etc/httpd/conf
