Therefore we would kindly ask you to create a basic Ansible Operator with the following functionality:

* Deploy an apache webserver (Amount of replicas defined by CustomResource)
* Create a Route/Ingress containing a Name defined in the CustomResource
- The Pods should serve a simple HTML File (Either defined in CustomResource or ConfigMaps
- Apache configuration should be rendered from a template and saved into a configMap

The following parameter should be configurable via CustomResource:
* Port apache listens on (rendered in apache.conf and service)

If a change to the configMap happens the operator should also trigger a redeployment of the webserver.
