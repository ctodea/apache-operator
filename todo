Therefore we would kindly ask you to create a basic Ansible Operator with the following functionality:

* Deploy an apache webserver (Amount of replicas defined by CustomResource)
* Create a Route/Ingress containing a Name defined in the CustomResource
- The Pods should serve a simple HTML File (Either defined in CustomResource or ConfigMaps
- Apache configuration should be rendered from a template and saved into a configMap

The following parameter should be configurable via CustomResource:
* Port apache listens on (rendered in apache.conf and service)

If a change to the configMap happens the operator should also trigger a redeployment of the webserver.


- add OLM bundle 
- fix manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml `Error: container create failed: time="2021-04-17T17:21:39Z" level=error msg="container_linux.go:366: starting container process caused: chdir to cwd (\"/home/nonroot\") set in config.json failed: permission denied"
